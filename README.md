flow-livewallpaper
==================

Note: You will need AmbilWarna to compile the project. (http://code.google.com/p/android-color-picker/)

Originally tested to run on the Galaxy s2, s3, note 2. Some newer phones with high density displays may have trouble rendering at a high frame rate.

Using OpenGL ES 2.0 and fluid rendering techniques Flow provides a beautiful and highly customizable interactive wallpaper to show off the rendering capabilities in modern Android phones. Flow comes preset with seven themes and a suite of customization options allowing you to tweak everything from the fluid color to the intensity of waves. Flow also allows you to insert custom photos, selected from the phone's gallery, underneath the surface of the liquid.
